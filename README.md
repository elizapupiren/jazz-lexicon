# The Digital Jazz Lexicon

The Digital Jazz Lexicon is a curated digital humanities project dedicated to exploring the rich intersection of jazz music and everyday language. Jazz, born in the early 20th century, gave rise to a vibrant vernacular that quickly permeated American culture and beyond. Terms like "cool," "hip," "dig," and "cat" moved from the bandstand to the street, the page, and the screen, becoming embedded in the fabric of modern expression. This project seeks to document that linguistic migration and examine how jazz slang not only reflected the ethos of its era but also shaped the voice of 20th‑century literature and poetry.

Our goal is to create a living lexicon that pairs precise definitions of jazz‑era slang with concrete examples of their use in published works—novels, short stories, poems, and memoirs—from the swing and bebop periods through the Beat generation and beyond. Each entry will include the term’s definition, its predominant musical era, and a representative quotation from a literary source. By anchoring the slang in actual texts, we hope to illustrate how the language of jazz became a vehicle for authenticity, rebellion, and artistic innovation across multiple genres.

The repository is structured as a simple, open‑access Markdown file (`lexicon.md`) that can be easily expanded, forked, or cited by educators, writers, and music enthusiasts. We invite contributions that uncover new literary examples, refine existing definitions, or propose additional terms that illustrate the enduring influence of jazz on the way we speak and write. Through collaborative curation, the Digital Jazz Lexicon aims to preserve a unique slice of cultural history and celebrate the ongoing dialogue between music and language.
